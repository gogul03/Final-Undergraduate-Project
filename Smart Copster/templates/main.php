            <p>When electricity generated using the solar panels fitted in your building/building is greater than the sum consumed, Rs. 22.00 per unit is payable to customers during the original 07 years, with a payment of Rs. 15.50 per unit starting in the 8th year. If the demand exceeds its output, the user needs to pay the additional energy consumed at the current tariff.</p>

            <p>The amount of energy produced by solar panels attached to their buildings/location is compensated for. There is no connection between the customer's energy use and power generation, as opposed to the net metering process. In accordance with the current fee, the user must pay for the power used. For the overall amount of energy it producing, the Electricity Board would pay.</p>
